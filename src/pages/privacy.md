# Privacy Policy

Welcome to **Horizon Application by Atlas** ("Application")! By using our Application, you agree to comply with the following privacy policy ("Privacy Policy"). Please read them carefully.

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our Application.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

1.1. We do not save any sensitive data outside of Discord. The only data we save is collected upon executing commands and when you perfoming actions to your server using Horizon, these logs include your user ID and guild ID for statistics purposes and for error logging. This data helps us improve the Application and provide a better experience for you.

1.2. We may log the settings you set up using the `/settings` command. None of this data is sensitive or dangerous to share. It is solely for your convenience, allowing you to customize your experience with the Application.

1.3. The Application saves messages that you set upon editing the automated notifications for each guild and each notification. 

1.4. The Application detects, using the Discord API, the device (computer, mobile) you are logged into to provide you with the corresponding interface for certain commands. This information is not stored anywhere. You can disable this tracking using the `/preferences` command, but you will have to select your device manually.

## 2. Data Removal

2.1. `/settings` data will be removed after 3 days if the Application leaves the server. If the Application is not re-invited within this timeframe, all data, including automation settings and messages, will be deleted. Users will have to re-configure them upon the Application's re-invitation.

2.2. If the Application rejoins the server before the end of the 2-day timeframe, this deletion process will be cancelled, and the user's data will remain intact.

2.3. To remove data, you can use the `/settings` command or contact us directly. Additionally, if you remove the Application from your server for 2 or more days, it will also trigger the deletion process.

2.4. Statistics data collected, including commands executed, successful executions, and automations posted in the server visible to server administrators with the command `/settings` will be deleted after 7 days when the Application leaves the server. If the Application is not re-invited within this timeframe, all statistics visible to the server owners will be deleted. Horizon may retain a minimal package of statistics data to improve their systems. For data deletion requests regarding this information, please contact us.

## Notice 
By using the Application, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, please do not use the Application. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us at info@teamatlas.dev
