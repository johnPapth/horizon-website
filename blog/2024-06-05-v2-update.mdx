## :clipboard: HORIZON UPDATE V2.0-COSMOS

Happy summer everyone! An amazing summer full of cool launches awaits us, but for now, here's the brand new version of Horizon with a lot of cool features to make your summer even better. 

### :sparkles:  Interactions Commands Have Been Added!
Horizon Interactions are commands that normal users can execute without the use of slash commands by tagging Horizon itself. Learn more in your Horizon server settings.
### :sparkles:  Device Tracking
Tired of an awful interface of /settings and other commands on mobile? Now Horizon tracks your device and provides you with the corresponding interface! Do not worry—it's 1000% privacy-friendly as it does not log anything about your device to us!

Still don't want to be tracked? Change it using the new command  /preferences!

### :rocket:  Quality of Life Updates & Changes
- Users can now navigate in the /settings command with the "Go Back" buttons instead of re-running the command.
- Made /settings & /help ephemeral so no other users can see these commands except the command author.
- Ability to remove command info button from your automations embed using /settings.
- Error messages now include more detailed information, including error codes for certain commands to share with the support team!
- Merged all the settings editors (buttons, colors, etc.) into one button with multiple select menus to make the whole design more minimal for both computer and mobile devices.
- Buttons for /articles, /blogs, and /reports now have a cooler design for easier navigation.
- We renamed all instances of "bot" to "Application", "App", and "Horizon".

### :rocket: Improvements
- Improvements have been made to the way we fetch "Next Event" data for faster results.
- Speed improvement in the time that automations are posted to all servers.
- Rover images for all rovers have been improved by +40%.
- Useless lines of code have been removed to improve the stability of Horizon.
