# Configuration
Discover how to efficiently configure Horizon's automations and access command information through Horizon Settings.

### What's settings?
The settings command is crucial for customizing Horizon's behavior on your server. This command is likely one you'll use frequently. To get started, simply run the command `/settings` in any channel, if you have permissions to do so. You're the only one who can see this message.

Use the select menu below to choose the category you wish to edit. You can always navigate back using the `Go Back` buttons.

 `/automations` utilizes device recognition. For more information, refer to our privacy policy. You can disable this feature using the `/preferences` command if desired but it's not recommended.

### How to customize enabled Automations?
Customizing enabled automations is straightforward using the Horizon interface directly on Discord. Use the command `/settings` and navigate to the automation you wish to edit using the select menu. When you modify a setting, Horizon automatically saves the changes instantly.

:::tip
Buttons and colors of automations can be edited in the Server Settings using the same command. Changes made here will affect all enabled automations in the specific server. To adjust button behavior and customize automation embeds, select the `Server Settings` menu from the `/settings` command.
