# Introduction

### Why Automations? What's this?
**The answer we give is simple:** to inspire dreams, to help people appreciate themselves, and to remind us how small we are in the vast universe. To live each day as something unique, knowing that not all planets have life. Some people will never die since they never get the chance to be born.

Automations are the feature we are most proud of because they allow you to learn everything humanity has achieved in our solar system and beyond. They showcase our intelligence and the relentless human spirit striving to understand our existence.

### How to enable Automations?
Enabling any automation is straightforward. Use the command `/automations` and select the function you wish to enable with the `Enable Function` option. You can include the optional `channel` value for specific channel activation.

### How to disable Automations?
Disabling an automation follows a similar process. Use the command `/automations` and select the function you want to disable with the `Disable Function` option. The `channel` option is not required and can be ignored. Additionally, automations can also be disabled using the `/settings` command and navigating to the selected automation.
